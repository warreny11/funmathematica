Change in Potential energy is (1/2)k(displacement)^2 horizontal and vertical–vertical, it is displ from the equilibrium.

use the differential equation : ma = kx&2

you get Asin(w)x + Bcos(w)x



T = 2π/omega                  

omega^2 = k/m



Fluid Statics :

pressure of a liquid always produces a force perpendicular to the surface

P = F/area

P2-P1 = density gh

P varies with depth beneath surface

F net of tank of water is zero

P2 - P1 = density(g)H

Bouyancy = Fb 

(P2-P1)A = weight of liquid displaced by object

static stuffs :-0 :-) ;0 :zero:
